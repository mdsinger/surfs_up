# surfs_up

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to compile weather data in Hawaii in order to try and obtain investor funding to open a Surf and Shake shop which would serve surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists.

## Results

 The results showed that the temperature difference between June and December was not that drastic and supports the idea that weather is fairly consistent through the year and should not have a major impact on the surf/ice cream shop's success.
 
 * The mean temperature in June was 74.9. The mean temperature in December was 71.04.
 
 * There were 1700 measurements taken in June and only 1517 in December. 
 
 * The minimum temperature in June was 64, while the minimum in December was 56. This suggests there may be some days in either month that would not be well suited for ice cream and surfing, however, the max temp in June was 85, while the max temp in December was 83, which suggests that there would be days in either month that would support ice cream and surfing.
 
 ## Summary
 
 The results of this analysis suggest that weather would not be a factor that would negatively affect the success of a surf and ice cream shop. It would also be useful to analyze the demand for this type of business and how many competitors are in the market. It would also be useful to gather more data points in December to more closely match the number of data points for June so that the analysis is more consistent. Another factor to consider would be surfing conditions in both June and December, such as wave height, etc.
